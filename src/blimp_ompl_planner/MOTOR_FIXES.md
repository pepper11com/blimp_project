# 🛠️ Critical Navigation Fixes - Round 2

## 🚨 **Issues Fixed:**

### **1. Motor Power Too Low** ✅
**Problem**: Motors only getting 2-3% power, not enough to move blimp
**Solution**: 
- Increased motor limits from ±20% to ±50%
- Increased forward PID output from 15 to 40
- Increased turn influence from 0.3 to 0.5

### **2. Missing Altitude OK State** ✅  
**Problem**: Only showed CLIMB/DESCEND, no neutral state
**Solution**:
- Added "OK" state for ±15cm altitude deadband
- Better altitude state reporting in debug output
- Servos stay neutral when close to target

### **3. Poor Path Quality (2 waypoints)** ✅
**Problem**: OMPL creating oversimplified start→end paths
**Solution**:
- Increased robot radius from 0.1m to 0.8m (forces better collision avoidance)
- Reduced simplification steps from 150 to 50 (keeps more waypoints)
- Added minimum waypoint distance parameter

### **4. Counter-Rotation Too Aggressive** ✅
**Problem**: Motors stopping when heading error > 25°
**Solution**:
- Only counter-rotate for heading errors > 150° (was 120°)
- Increased rotation power and turn influence
- Better normal differential steering

## 🎯 **Expected Results:**

1. **Higher Motor Power**: Should see 10-30% motor values instead of 2-3%
2. **Altitude OK State**: Will show "OK" when within 15cm of target
3. **Better Paths**: More waypoints, smoother routes with proper clearance
4. **Continuous Movement**: Less stopping, better turning behavior

## 📊 **Test Command:**
```bash
# Set reasonable altitude
ros2 run blimp_ompl_planner set_altitude.py 1.0

# Send goal - should now get multi-waypoint path
ros2 topic pub --once /goal_pose geometry_msgs/PoseStamped '{header: {frame_id: "map"}, pose: {position: {x: 2.0, y: -3.0, z: 0.0}, orientation: {w: 1.0}}}'
```

## 🔍 **What to Look For:**
- **Motor Values**: 15-40% instead of 2-3%
- **Altitude State**: Should show "OK" when close
- **Path Quality**: Should get 10+ waypoints instead of 2
- **Continuous Motion**: Less stopping and starting

The blimp should now have much more responsive and powerful navigation! 🚁⚡
